## Web starter

This is a basic web boilerplate project. To use it, fork this repo and clone it.
You can then edit the files in `/src/`.

This includes TypeScript and SASS, but you can write in plain CSS and JavaScript
instead if you prefer.

It includes [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) which
handles compilation, bundling etc. Just link things in your HTML and they should
work.

To begin, type:

```sh
npm i
```

Then to run the development server, type:

```sh
npm start
```

You can then open http://localhost:1234/

To build for production, type:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will build a production site in `dist`.
